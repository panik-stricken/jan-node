Why not start from the start?

Technically, javaScript would be the start, and that would redirect to HTML being the start, which further would be helpful with a little HTTP, and you can keep finding smaller and easier places to start until you discover that the best place to start might be Quantum Mechanics...  

In a world of circular redundant chaos however, you have to start somewhere... and since our goal is to write software, we are going to skip a few steps here and there, ignore some details (or at least not give them full documentation, as others have done that), and dive in where my intuition says too.
